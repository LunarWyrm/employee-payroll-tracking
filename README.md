Lines 9 through 11 in script.js are from working with other student in class.
Lines 27 through 33 in script.js were made referencing https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29544371/finding-the-average-of-an-array-using-js

Line 43, previously, averageSalarySubtotal += employeesArray[i];
Used ChatGPT to tell me what I was doing wrong and it told me I needed to use parseInt() to convert the salary from an object into an integer. Also added ".salary" to take from the salary section of the employee's saved data.

Line 48 ChatGPT, without asking, had changed it to be only 2 decimal places. I asked why and if it would work without that. Since I decided I liked it showing only two decimal places, I kept it.

Tutor Sean New helped me understand and brainstorm during this project
